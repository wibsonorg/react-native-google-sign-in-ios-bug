# Bug

## The Problem

On iOS, the user session is lost after closing the app.

## Expected Behavior

User session is kept alive after closing and re-opening the app. Google Sign In library shows the current user and can read current tokens.

## Actual Behavior

`getTokens` throws exception, `getCurrentUser` returns `null` **BUT** `isSignedIn` returns `true`‚ùó 
Firebase Auth still shows the user.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. `git clone https://github.com/wibsonorg/react-native-google-sign-in-ios-bug.git`
3. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` file from Firebase and add it at `ios/GoogleService-Info.plist`.
4. Add the `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` as an URL Type.
5. Run `yarn && yarn ios`
6. Sign in with any google account.
7. Force the app to close (see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330 for specific instructions on how to do it in your model).
8. Re-open app.
9. Tap on the "Is Signed In?" and "Get Current User" buttons.

## More Insights
`getTokens` and `getCurrentUser` depend on reading the user by doing:
```
GIDGoogleUser *currentUser = [GIDSignIn sharedInstance].currentUser;
```
But `currentUser` is null since the app was closed and it does not restore it automatically from keychain.
I tried calling the following right before getting the user:
```
[[GIDSignIn sharedInstance] restorePreviousSignIn];
```
This should restore the user using the keychain, but it did nothing.
